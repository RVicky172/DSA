# Phase 5: Scale & Polish - Day 1 Implementation

**Date**: December 6, 2025
**Duration**: 1 Day (8 hours planned)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on scaling the platform with advanced features and user experience improvements. This is the final phase before full production release. Building on the robust infrastructure from Phase 4, we're adding:

1. **Search Functionality** - Full-text search for lessons and problems
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - User statistics and platform insights
3. **Recommendation Engine** - Intelligent problem suggestions based on user progress
4. **Performance Optimization** - Caching, query optimization, and bundle size reduction
5. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Enhanced UI for mobile devices
6. **Dark Mode** - Theme toggle for better accessibility
