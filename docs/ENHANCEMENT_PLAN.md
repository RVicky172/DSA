## Phase 5: Scale & Polish (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Performance optimization, advanced features, and user experience improvements.

### Backlog Items

| Item | Priority | Estimated Effort |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Analytics dashboard (completion rates, popular problems) | 🟡 P1 | 3d |
| Search functionality (lessons, problems) | 🟡 P1 | 2d |
| Notifications (new lessons, comments) | 🟢 P2 | 2d |
| Discussion/comments on problems | 🟢 P2 | 3d |
| Subscription tiers & payments (Stripe) | 🟢 P2 | 4d |
| Mobile-responsive design refinement | 🟡 P1 | 2d |

| Custom judge microservice (self-hosted) | 🟢 P2 | 5d |
| Problem difficulty recommendations | 🟢 P2 | 2d |
| API rate limiting & throttling | 🟡 P1 | 1d |

---

## 📋 Technical Debt & Maintenance

- **Testing:** Add unit tests for all services (backend) and component tests (frontend)
- **Documentation:** Keep docs/legacy/ in sync with code; update README on major changes
- **Refactoring:** Modularize large components; extract reusable hooks
- **Dependencies:** Monthly npm audit and security patches
- **Performance:** Measure and optimize API response times and bundle size

## 📊 Resource Allocation (Estimated)

| Phase | Backend | Frontend | DevOps | Total |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 (MVP) | 2 weeks | 2 weeks | 1 week | 4 weeks |
| Phase 2 (Interactivity) | 2 weeks | 1.5 weeks | 0.5 week | 4 weeks |
| Phase 3 (Content Mgmt) | 1 week | 1.5 weeks | 0 week | 2.5 weeks |
| Phase 4 (DevOps) | 0.5 week | 0 week | 2 weeks | 2.5 weeks |
| **Total (MVP to Prod)** | **5.5 weeks** | **5 weeks** | **3.5 weeks** | **13 weeks** |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Week 1 Actions
1. [ ] Finalize database schema (review with team)
2. [ ] Create Prisma migration files
3. [ ] Set up GitHub project board
4. [ ] Assign Phase 1 tickets

### Dependencies
- All phases depend on **Phase 1** completion
- Phase 2 depends on **Phase 1** API stability
- Phase 4 can run in parallel with **Phase 3**

---

## 📞 Questions & Adjustments

- **Timelines tight?** Consider reducing Phase 3 scope (e.g., skip markdown editor initially)
- **Need faster?** Prioritize Phase 1 + Phase 2, defer Phase 3 to later
- **Budget constraints?** Skip Phase 5 polish items until MVP is live
