# Daily Progress Tracking

This folder contains daily logs of work progress on the DSA Learning Platform, organized by date.

## Structure

Each day has its own folder with:
- `README.md` - Detailed work log with tasks, accomplishments, blockers, and next steps
- Code changes are tracked via git commits with descriptive messages

## Format

Every daily log includes:
- **Date & Phase** - Current development phase (e.g., Phase 1: MVP)
- **Planned Tasks** - What we aimed to accomplish
- **Completed** - What was actually done
- **Blockers** - Any issues encountered
- **Code Changes** - Git commits and file modifications
- **Next Steps** - What's planned for the next session
- **Time Spent** - Estimate of work hours
